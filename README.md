# face-and-body-detector-with-mediapipe

This code detects face and body landmarks using mediapipe, a python ML package. The code is adapted from [nicknochnack's](https://github.com/nicknochnack) longer tutorial on using mediapipe for body language detection that can be found [here](https://github.com/nicknochnack/Body-Language-Decoder/blob/main/Body%20Language%20Decoder%20Tutorial.ipynb).
